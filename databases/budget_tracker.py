"""
Write an application that keeps track of a householdâ€™s budget.
The user can add expenses, income, and recurring costs to find out
how much they are saving or losing over a period of time.

Optional: Allow the user to specify a date range and
see the net flow of money in and out of the house budget for that time period.

probabilmente spostare le funzioni in altro file e qui mettere runtime
