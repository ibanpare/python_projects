"""You will develop a Python program to dynamically complete certain tasks,
 such as list, find, sort, and save, in course listings from the scheduling portal.
 You will mainly use "request" and "BeautifulSoup" libraries (or similar, see exercise 12.1).
 The program will operate at a different level: Semester and Department.
 Your program will be a menu-based application. Assume that your project file is myproject.py.
 Once you run, it will show the last 5 semester
 (fall, spring, summer-only, (not wintersemester or, may mini semester))"""
